Once there was a box of uncooked couscous named Allison. She lived in the top right corner of the third shelf in the kitchen, and was so friendly that all of the other foods adored her.

On the bottom left corner of the chelf there lived a box of quinoa. Before the couscous came to live in the kitchen, quinoa used to be the adored food of choice. All the foods wished they could be the quinoa, and wished they had as many dietary nutritional values and her. However when the human stopped her diet, the quinoa was moved to the bottom of the shelf, and everyone ignored the sad box of quinoa.
