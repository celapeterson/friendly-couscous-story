Once there was a box of uncooked couscous named Allison. She lived in the top right corner of the third shelf in the kitchen, and was so friendly that all of the other foods adored her.

On the bottom left corner of the chelf there lived a box of quinoa. Before the couscous came to live in the kitchen, quinoa used to be the adored food of choice. All the foods wished they could be the quinoa, and wished they had as many dietary nutritional values and her. However when the human stopped her diet, the quinoa was moved to the bottom of the shelf, and everyone ignored the sad box of quinoa.

As time went on, the quinoa worried that its owner would never come back to eat it again. It decided that it had to bring up its concerns to Allison in hopes that it could return to its former perch on the kitchen shelf. However, when the quinoa tried to climb up to talk to Allison, it realized that it had a hole in the bottom of its box, and the quinoa could only make it up to the second shelf. It hoped that its owner would at least pay it enough attention to be used one last time.
